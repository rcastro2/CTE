	<opportunity title="BEBRAS Computing Challenge 2014" posted="05 DEC 14" logo="images/events/bebras.png">
		<description ><![CDATA[
		The Bebras Computing Challenge introduces computational thinking to students. It is organized in over 30 countries and designed to get students all over the world excited about computing.  Each participant gets 45 minutes to answer 15 multiple-choice questions that focus on computational and logical thinking. It is completed online in your own school and it shows to school and student how well their skills are developed.<br/><br/>
		<b>What is computational thinking?</b><br/>
		Originally it involves a set of problem-solving skills that software engineers use to write programs and apps. You can break these skills down in smaller and more familiar components like pattern recognition, algorithm design, data analysis or abstraction. Computational thinking is used in more areas than just software, so it is very useful to get acquainted. Want to know more?

		<description ><![CDATA[
		The USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) supports computing education in the USA and worldwide by identifying, motivating, and training pre-college students of all levels in computational problem-solving. For its 2014-2015 season, the USACO plans to offer four monthly on-line programming contests:
		<ul>
		<li>Dec 12-15: First Contest</li>
		<li>Jan 16-19: Second Contest</li>
		<li>Feb 20-23: Third Contest</li>
		<li>April 3-6: US Open (our championship contest)</li>
		</ul>
		Contests are free and open to all; they are targeted specifically at pre-college students, although others may compete as observers, ranked separately. There are three levels of difficulty: bronze (novice), silver (intermediate), and gold (advanced). All new competitors start out in the bronze level, which is designed to be accessible to students with basic programming knowledge and minimal algorithmic experience. Students earn promotion to higher levels by demonstrating excellent performance on a contest in their current level. Contests are usually 3-5 consecutive hours in duration, which students can schedule any time during a 4-day contest window. Students can submit programs in C, C++, Java, Pascal, or Python. All contests are taken individually.
