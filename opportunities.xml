What do Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter have in common? They were all created by people who knew how to code. Programming is a skill that gives you the ability to create and innovate. How cool would it be to take an idea and watch it come to life through programming? All it takes is the willingness to try something new, and the dedication to work at it. That’s what CodeNow is for!  We introduce you to programming in a fun and interactive way.<br/><br/>

Our workshops take place in San Francisco and New York City on the weekends at local tech companies, and are led by top software engineers. Accepted students will be given puzzles and activities to complete before the workshop. Those who complete the workshop will have an opportunity to continue with CodeNow and earn a laptop. It will not be easy, but you’ll definitely have fun and learn a lot along the way. And we’ll provide you with all the tools and resources to get you on your way to become a great programmer.<br/><br/>

Does this sound like fun and something you might be interested in? We’re currently accepting applications which are due on February 5th. If selected, you’ll receive a scholarship worth $250 in order to attend the program. Which means it’s free and you get to brag to all your friends!
