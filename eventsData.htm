		How many things can you control with your smartphone?  Internet of Things (IoT) is a proposed development of the Internet in which everyday objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data.
		Imagine,
		<ol>
			<li>Getting a text message any time the front door opens in your house.</li>
			<li>Coffee pot that starts brewing once your within a few blocks of your house.</li>
			<li>Buttons on your fridge that you press to send a message to the local grocery store in order to buy and delivery more milk.</li>
		</ol>
		The above mentioned examples are not fiction but actual technologies that already exists.  IoT is only limited by your imagination.<br/><br/>
		Members of Microsoft's Technical Evangelist Team, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ActiveNick" target="_blank">Nick Landry<a/> and <a href="http://thebitchwhocodes.com/" target="_blank">Stacey Mulcahy</a> lead groups of professionals which included Bayside High School students of the Computer Programming CTE through a simple IoT lab.  Students programmed a weather shield on an Adruino to collect temperature data.  Data fed into a Raspberry Pi which communicated the information into event hubs on Microsoft Azure.  From Microsoft Azure the data could then be view through a web site on your smartphone.  <br/><br/>The lab was unassumingly called <a href="https://github.com/msopentech/connectthedots" target="_blank">Connect the Dots</a><br/>

		<description>
		Ever wonder how we are able to access websites and resources from across the world in just seconds.  That question motivated one student to call the corporate headquarters of DISH Network and start a conversation that ultimately led to a site visit of their international service call center.
		<br/><br/>
		The site visit was divided in three parts:
		<ol>
			<li><b>Service Call Center</b> - Students observed as service calls requesting foreign language support were monitored and routed to an appropriate service representative.  Students received a demonstration of DISH Network's custom developed service software.<br/><br/></li>
			<li><b>Server Room</b> - Students saw how individual terminals received their Internet by connecting through patch panels, routers and ironically enough Verizon fiber optics.  Students were in awe of the servers with so much data storage that led to the question "What comes after terabyte?"<br/><br/></li>
			<li><b>Installation Warehouse</b> - Students explored the various equipment that make DISH able to deliver connectivity to so many customers.  Tailgater wowed the students as they contemplated playing Call of Duty on their next camping tour.</li>
		</ol>

		<description>A hack day is about celebrating the hacker community at your school by coming together and building awesome projects together! During the hack day your community will come together to create and build community together over 12 hours. MLH will be providing awesome programming and swag all day long to help celebrate all the Hacker Community everywhere.
		<br/><br/>
		Bayside High School had a strong representation with close to 20 students participating.  Students had to develop an idea, pitch and gather support from fellow students, implement, and demonstrate the product.  Amongst the Bayside contingent, three projects emerged.<br/>
		<ul>
		<li><b><i>Play That Tune</b></i> -  Game challenged players to complete the circuit using pennies connected to the arduino in order to play various tunes.<br/></li>
		<li><b><i>Study Group Meetup</b></i> - App allowed students to post topics they want to study and find students with similar interest.<br/></li>
		<li><b><i>Snapshot Search</b></i> - Using the camera on an android device, the app allowed user to take snap a picture of an object and pull up any information it could find on Google.<br/></li>
		<li><b><i>Relieve Joke</b></i> -  When you are stressed, try a joke. App display a random joke when you shake the android device.<br/></li>
		</ul>
		Though only one project made it to the final stages, implementation and demonstration, all students gained invaluable experience in project development.

		<description>Bayside High School CTE Computer Programming and Web Design students attended "Engadget Expand NY 2014” at the Jacob Javitz Center. Expand is an interactive experience designed from the ground up for technology fans. It’s a free, 10,000+ attendee event that gives tech enthusiasts the unique opportunity to hear from favorite tech innovators and science luminaries on stage, meet the Engadget editors face to face, and get their hands on some of the latest and greatest new devices on the show floor.
		<br/><br/>
		The event was crawling with new innovating products, literally and figuratively.
		<ul>
		<li>Lego Mindstorms EV3 designed a robotic snake that crawled along the floor and would strike visitors as they got near, which was a  big hit with the crowd.</li>
		<li>Why not let your eyes do the walking, by slipping on "Matterport".  This innovation allows a person to move freely within a 3D virtual environment of real indoor locations.</li>
		<li>Can  you play a piano made of bananas and celery?  Anything is possible when you close a circuit, according to Geek Academy in conjunction with BestBuy.</li>
		<li>There were many of innovations related to consumer’s health, such as "UpRight", a portable application that monitors a wearer’s posture.  The wearer receives a gentle vibration if their posture slips out of alignment.</li>
		<li>Real life robots are topics of many futuristic sci-fi movies.  Nano states “the future is getting nearer” as they showcased a miniature robot that walks, kicks and interacts with humans.</li>
		<li>Need a new knob for a door?  Is the latch on your zipper broke? Well, why not just print it out?  MakerBot’s 3D printer allows the user to do exactly that with organic liquids.</li>
		<li>Perhaps traveling along on a futuristic self-powered skateboard, like in the movie Back to the Future is more your speed.  LEIF and many other companies such as Toyota are exploring innovations in transportation.</li>
		</ul>

		Regardless of the technology, programming and engineering is an integral part of any new innovations.

		It's a 24-hour event where students passionate about technology get together and build cool things together! You pitch ideas, form teams, and build a cool app or game over 24 hours! Part of the fun is figuring things things as you go along. Workshops were held to assist.  We're constantly amazed by the results after CodeDay! For instance, Mohammad Adib created and published <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mohammad.adib.sidebar.lite&hl=en" target="_blank">Sidebar</a>, an Android app with &gt; 200,000 downloads at CodeDay!
		<br/><br/>
		CodeDay was organized by StudentRND and sponsored by companies such as Splunk,General Assembly and Amazon Web Services.  Students brought their tools, a laptop, a power strip and a healthy portion of motivation.  Some students opted to sleep over at the FlatIron School, bringing a sleeping bag, pillows, toothbrush, and anything else that made them comfortable.

		This year marks the first annual Congressional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academic Competition, the “House Student App Challenge.” This new challenge is designed to engage student’s creativity and encourage their participation in STEM education fields. Established by Members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, this challenge is a nationwide event that allows high school students from across the country to learn by creating and exhibiting their software application, or “app,” for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice.
		<br/><br/>
		The “House Student App Challenge” is open to all high school students in participating districts. Students entering the competition must submit their app’s source code online during the Competition Submission Period between 12 PM Eastern Standard Time on FEBRUARY 1ST, 2014, and 11:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time on APRIL 30TH, 2014, as well as provide a YouTube or VIMEO video demo explaining their app and what they learned through this competition process.
<br/><br/>
Below are the submissions from two Bayside High School teams.<br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGd4yHz_PgI">NYC Job Search</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLi6rx8QOt4">Summer Youth Employment Search</a></li>
</ul>
Both solutions used C# and data from NYC Open Data to produce interactive desktop applications.

		Presented by the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), and TreSensa, the Spring Break Game Jam aims to provide New York City high school students from under-resourced communities, the opportunity to learn about professional game development and to build related technical skills. With the support of volunteer mentors, each student team will create a mobile game that runs on the TreSensa Game Engine and a 3-min pitch presentation to showcase their work.
		<br/><br/>
		As part of a five student team, three Bayside High School students created PIXSEA, a 2D side scrolling game with pixel themed graphics. The player takes the role of a fish, trying to escape a shark. During the chase, the player has to avoid obstacles, including fish hooks, crab and jellyfish. At the same time, the player has to collect bubbles to last longer in the game. If the player hits an obstacle or runs out of bubbles, the game will end. The game is a fun, addictive, and challenging runner.

		Bayside High School officially threw their hat into the Robotics arena this year.  Team 8117 Bayside Overflow was formed.  This year's competition involved scoring blocks in baskets, raising a flag and hooking onto a bar to lift the robot.  If you had a chance to experience the competition you may had thought you were watching a high school basketball match with the amount of energy that was present.
		<br/><br/>
Team 8117, Bayside Overflow respectfully place 13 out of 27 teams at the US FIRST Qualifier (LEWIS BLITZ) at Francis High School.  The field included schools from Francis Lewis, Stuyvesant and various other Long Island and NYC teams.  <br/><br/>Despite the midfield placement, Bayside Overflow was nominated by one of the winning teams to be a partner in the Red Alliance in the final matches.  Through the final rounds Bayside Overflow had a chance to demonstrate their perseverance and determination.  It came down to the final tie-breaking match.  Bayside Overflow came in 2nd Place earning the 2013-2014 US FIRST Tech Challenge New York City and Long Island QT Finalist Alliance Award.  This was an excellent start to many more great things to come.

		Ever wonder...<br/>
How cell phones do the things they do? <br/>
How robots on an assembly line create a car? <br/>
How video games look and feel so realistic?   <br/><br/>

During Computer Science Education Week December 9 - 15 in support of Hour of Code, Bayside High School hosted various workshops designed to demystify "code" and show students, parents, faculty and members of the Bayside community that anyone can learn the basics to be a maker, a creator, an innovator.
<br/><br/>

According to Code.org, the promoter behind Hour of Code, <br/>
1) by 2020 there will be 1.4 billion computing jobs with only 400,000 computer science students graduated.  <br/>

2) Computer Science is one of the highest paid degrees.<br/>

3) 90% of schools in the US do not teach computer science. Luckily Bayside High School does!<br/>

Fog Creek, software company specializing in project management tools, hosted four Bayisde High School students for a day.  The day was packed with various work based experiences.<br/><br/>
1) <b>Presentation of the Bayside Business Association website redesign by interns</b> -  Having the opportunity to present their work in a professional environment validated the work the interns did on the BBA redesign project.
<br/><br/>
2) <b>Table side chat and Lunch</b> - Shared personal experiences that led to being involved in software development.  Viewed demonstrations of Kiln, Trello and etherPad.  During lunch students mingled with various departments from Fog Creek.  We truly felt welcomed.<br/><br/>

3) <b>Mock Interview and Code discussion</b> - Experiencing a mock interview was exciting. Analysing different algorithms of the "seach for the first instance of a character from the set" allowed us to work as part of a team coding together.<br/><br/>
4) <b>Tour of Fog Creek</b> - Students saw the kind of environment they could work in as a software developer.  "Wow. I could work here!" was the general sentiment.
<br/><br/>

It was great how everyone at Fog Creek welcomed us.  Motivating experience for all.
