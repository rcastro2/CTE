		Ever wonder...<br/>
How cell phones do the things they do? <br/>
How robots on an assembly line create a car? <br/>
How video games look and feel so realistic?   <br/><br/>  
 
During Computer Science Education Week December 9 - 15 in support of Hour of Code, Bayside High School hosted various workshops designed to demystify "code" and show students, parents, faculty and members of the Bayside community that anyone can learn the basics to be a maker, a creator, an innovator.  
<br/><br/>

According to Code.org, the promoter behind Hour of Code, <br/>
1) by 2020 there will be 1.4 billion computing jobs with only 400,000 computer science students graduated.  <br/>

2) Computer Science is one of the highest paid degrees.<br/>

3) 90% of schools in the US do not teach computer science. Luckily Bayside High School does!<br/>

		<description>picoCTF is a computer security game targeted at high school students and above. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.
<br/><br/>
<b><em>&#9734; Bayside High School's team Bayside Overflow placed 280 across a national field of 1938 teams.</em></b><br/><br/>
picoCTF is open-source and a report on the success of the competition is freely available. The adventure for picoCTF 2013 was Toaster Wars. When a robot from space crash lands in your backyard it's up to your hacking skills to fix him and uncover the secret he carries...<br/>

		<description>
Fog Creek, software company specializing in project management tools, hosted four Bayisde High School students for a day.  The day was packed with various work based experiences.<br/><br/>
1) <b>Presentation of the Bayside Business Association website redesign by interns</b> -  Having the opportunity to present their work in a professional environment validated the work the interns did on the BBA redesign project.  
<br/><br/>
2) <b>Table side chat and Lunch</b> - Shared personal experiences that led to being involved in software development.  Viewed demonstrations of Kiln, Trello and etherPad.  During lunch students mingled with various departments from Fog Creek.  We truly felt welcomed.<br/><br/>

3) <b>Mock Interview and Code discussion</b> - Experiencing a mock interview was exciting. Analysing different algorithms of the "seach for the first instance of a character from the set" allowed us to work as part of a team coding together.<br/><br/>
4) <b>Tour of Fog Creek</b> - Students saw the kind of environment they could work in as a software developer.  "Wow. I could work here!" was the general sentiment.
<br/><br/>

It was great how everyone at Fog Creek welcomed us.  Motivating experience for all.
