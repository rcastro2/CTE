		This year marks the first annual Congressional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Academic Competition, the “House Student App Challenge.” This new challenge is designed to engage student’s creativity and encourage their participation in STEM education fields. Established by Members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, this challenge is a nationwide event that allows high school students from across the country to learn by creating and exhibiting their software application, or “app,” for mobile, tablet, or computer devices on a platform of their choice.

Team 8117, Bayside Overflow respectfully place 13 out of 27 teams at the US FIRST Qualifier (LEWIS BLITZ) at Francis High School.  The field included schools from Francis Lewis, Stuyvesant and various other Long Island and NYC teams.  <br/><br/>Despite the midfield placement, Bayside Overflow was nominated by one of the winning teams to be a partner in the Red Alliance in the final matches.  Through the final rounds Bayside Overflow had a chance to demonstrate their perseverance and determination.  It came down to the final tie-breaking match.  Bayside Overflow came in 2nd Place earning the 2013-2014 US FIRST Tech Challenge New York City and Long Island QT Finalist Alliance Award.  This was an excellent start to many more great things to come.

		Bayside High School officially threw their hat into the Robotics arena this year.  Team 8117 Bayside Overflow was formed.  This year's competition involved scoring blocks in baskets, raising a flag and hooking onto a bar to lift the robot.  If you had a chance to experience the competition you may had thought you were watching a high school basketball match with the amount of energy that was present.

		Ever wonder...<br/>
How cell phones do the things they do? <br/>
How robots on an assembly line create a car? <br/>
How video games look and feel so realistic?   <br/><br/>  
 
During Computer Science Education Week December 9 - 15 in support of Hour of Code, Bayside High School hosted various workshops designed to demystify "code" and show students, parents, faculty and members of the Bayside community that anyone can learn the basics to be a maker, a creator, an innovator.  
<br/><br/>

According to Code.org, the promoter behind Hour of Code, <br/>
1) by 2020 there will be 1.4 billion computing jobs with only 400,000 computer science students graduated.  <br/>

2) Computer Science is one of the highest paid degrees.<br/>

3) 90% of schools in the US do not teach computer science. Luckily Bayside High School does!<br/>

		<description>picoCTF is a computer security game targeted at high school students and above. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.
<br/><br/>
<b><em>&#9734; Bayside High School's team Bayside Overflow placed 280 across a national field of 1938 teams.</em></b><br/><br/>
picoCTF is open-source and a report on the success of the competition is freely available. The adventure for picoCTF 2013 was Toaster Wars. When a robot from space crash lands in your backyard it's up to your hacking skills to fix him and uncover the secret he carries...<br/>

Fog Creek, software company specializing in project management tools, hosted four Bayisde High School students for a day.  The day was packed with various work based experiences.<br/><br/>
1) <b>Presentation of the Bayside Business Association website redesign by interns</b> -  Having the opportunity to present their work in a professional environment validated the work the interns did on the BBA redesign project.  
<br/><br/>
2) <b>Table side chat and Lunch</b> - Shared personal experiences that led to being involved in software development.  Viewed demonstrations of Kiln, Trello and etherPad.  During lunch students mingled with various departments from Fog Creek.  We truly felt welcomed.<br/><br/>

3) <b>Mock Interview and Code discussion</b> - Experiencing a mock interview was exciting. Analysing different algorithms of the "seach for the first instance of a character from the set" allowed us to work as part of a team coding together.<br/><br/>
4) <b>Tour of Fog Creek</b> - Students saw the kind of environment they could work in as a software developer.  "Wow. I could work here!" was the general sentiment.
<br/><br/>

It was great how everyone at Fog Creek welcomed us.  Motivating experience for all.
